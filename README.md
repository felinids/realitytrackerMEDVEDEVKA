# Reality Tracker
This fork  provides an easy way to view PR Trackers for all relevant maps, including those that were deleted in the last few years,
and the related github.io also fixes some issues with the yossizap.github.io instance (broken menu).

.PRDEMO files are created by the realitytracker.py script. The goal is to provide as much data as possible to analyse matches for learning and administration without launching the game to use DICE's Battlerecoder.

It was originally a [C# project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqPZUMPv2ss&feature=youtu.be&t=447) that automatically uploaded server recordings to youtube but it was decided to make it a portable web application.

### See realitytracker in action
You can play a live match from the project reality tournament [here](https://tournament.realitymod.com/prt_mods/tracker/?demo=files/c13_b9.PRdemo#185). For more you can visit public server's websites or PRT's [replay archive](https://tournament.realitymod.com/showthread.php?p=375923).

### Usage
- Clone the tracker or use the [github pages](https://yossizap.github.io/realitytracker/) hosted master branch version

### Tracker protocol
See [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ArciEg1rkG_MHzSYWphje1s071a6kD2ojuD58nVmwAE/edit#gid=0) for the full protocol documentation. The protocol uses a very minimal implementation because the server side code has to run in the game's mainloop and it's intended to work over bad network.

In each configured game tick interval the tracker sends a single packet/writes to the .PRdemo file with different types of updates. The parser parses the headers of each update and then it's content based on the 'message type' opcodes. Each 'message' is internally cached. For example, if the parser finds MESSAGETYPE_PLAYER_UPDATE(0x10) it will start parsing the following strucutre(you can find it in the PLAYER_UPDATE sheet)

| Description                                | Type                    | Length          |

The update flags uses an enum with bitmasks to mark which fields changed so the parser will only look for those. In addition to that only players that had changes in cached fields will have their updates sent in the first place. 

The relevant code is in [js/parser.js](https://github.com/yossizap/realitytracker/blob/master/js/parser.js) and [js/protocol.js](https://github.com/yossizap/realitytracker/blob/master/js/protocol.js). For the server's side see realitytracker.py.
